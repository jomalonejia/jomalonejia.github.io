    <p>
        You don't need docker-machine to manage the Hyper-V virtual machine.
        In fact you can't unless you configure it explicitly for it.
        If you want to see your ip use the Docker for Windows GUI.

        Docker team want you use Docker for Windows like a regular docker in Linux and don't bother about virtual machine stuff.

        Docker-machine is included in the same way you can install in Linux.
        It is for manage machines in the cloud for example or access remote docker engine.
        For example in Linux you issue your docker commands in a natural way but you can also have a virtual machine with docker and manage it using docker-machine in your host.
        Now in Windows it works in the same way.
